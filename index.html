<!--
This is an html website.
This part tells the browser
which programming language and dialect
this page is written in so it can read it
(or at least which language it starts in).
In this case, we used HTML 5.
(Other dialects use much longer declarations.)
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
This part is written in HTML.
You can tell because of the angle brackets
a.k.a. chevrons (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket)
a.k.a. (non-julienned) carrots
........ METADATA ........
We put all our metadata before the content (body).
Metadata is stuff that doesn't actually show up
but is more informational.

In the HTML 5 standard, the following tags can be omitted:
  <html> is used to better define the document root
  <head>
  <body>
But it is good practice to keep them for compatibility purposes.
Additional metadata tags:
  <title> is used to name the browser tab, per se
  <meta> is used for assorted behind-the-scenes information
  <base> is used for establishing defaults for your site
  <style> is used for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  <script> is used for JavaScript (not to be confused with Java)
  <link> is used to reference an external source
    (e.g. a style sheet located somewhere else)

Instead of simply putting down the <html> tag,
Let's take advantage of the opportunity to add purpose;
Let's also establish the page language as US-English.
-->
<html lang="en-US">

<!--
This part is the head of the webpage.
It is a required component and should only be used once.
It is always paired with and before the body.
We can think of it like the cover of a book
including the pages with the publishing information,
disclosures, dedications, bar codes, etc.
-->
<head>

  <!--
  This is the name of the webpage.
  It will show up on the browser tab
  (looks like the label on a file folder).
  It will show up as the default name
  if the user tries to bookmark the page
  so make it a good one!
  -->
  <title>The Janning | Home</title>

  <!--
  This is where we put keywords.
  These make it easier for this webpage to pull up
  when the keywords are entered into a search engine.
  -->
  <meta name="keywords" content="Janning, learning, html, CSS">

  <!--
  This is where we give credit to the person who built this webpage.
  -->
  <meta name="author" content="Janning Chow"

  <!--
  This is where we add a little blurb or summary
  about the contents of the webpage.
  -->
  <meta name="description" content="
    This is the experimental website
    for Janning to learn and practice
    front-end development (html & CSS).
  ">

  <!--
  This is where we can designate how frequently
  the web browser re-loads the webpage.
  Since we have no use for it right now,
  we can keep it in the comments.

  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="300">
  -->

  <!--
  This is where we can designate the site address
  (all the pages are attached after the slash).
  Browsers that read HTML5 won't need this spelled out explicitly.
  Since we want Atom to be able to read this,
  we can keep it in the comments for now.

  <base href="http://janning.github.io/">
  -->

  <!--
  This is where we can designate what happens when the user clicks a link.
  In this case, it will load in place of what is currently showing
  (i.e. in the same window/tab, vs. in a separate window/tab).
  Browsers that read HTML5 won't need this spelled out explicitly.
