<!--
This is where, in the heading,
we add an attribute
specifically a link
that takes you to this specific website
and the link spans across the designated character(s).
In this case,
"Hello!"
-->
<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello">Hello!</a></h1>
<!--
This is where we put the contents of the paragraph
and later in the paragraph,
we add an attribute
specifically a link
that takes you to this specific website
and the link spans across the designated character(s).
In this case,
"robot".
-->
<p>I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robot">robot</a>.</p>
<!--
This is where we add a stand-alone link
by skipping directly to adding the attribute
that takes you to this specific website
and the link spans across the designated character(s).
In this case,
"Wiki everything!"
-->
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wiki everything!</a>
<!--
This is far easier than using MLA or APA citation 
and memorizing their style guides for your term papers
(in my personal opinion).

<p>
Hello I am another robot!
